Welcome to the **Colorstack-API** repository!

This project was created for the **Colorstack Winter-Break Hackathon**. The goal of this project is simple. Lets break it down

# Problem
- 90% of ColorStack Members are CS & SWE Students, and the best way to grow as engineers is by building projects!
- While ColorStack already has Oyster, its issues for contribution is somewhat limited. To address this, we developed Colorstack-API, designed to sit on top of the Oyster platform. For this hackathon, we are using Supabase to simulate the Oyster Db. This idea, has the potential to grow far beyond its current scope, if integrated with oyster!

# Solution
- We created **[Colorstack-API](https://apiurlcolorstack.vercel.app/)** and **[Colorstack-API-Dashboard](https://colorstack-api.vercel.app)** 
- These tools empower ColorStack members to build applications specifically tailored for the ColorStack community.
- This initiative fosters greater inclusivity and involvement, encouraging members to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the community through project-based learning.
- our slogan is _**For stackers by Stackers!**_

# Overview
## Description of the ColorStack API
The ColorStack API is a robust backend service designed to facilitate the management and interaction with various data entities related to educational and collaborative environments. It integrates seamlessly with Supabase, providing a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage users, Slack channels, messages, and reactions.
Key Features:
   - User Management: Allows for the retrieval and management of student profiles, including their details such as name and email.
   - Slack Integration: Provides endpoints to manage Slack channels, messages, and reactions, enabling users to interact with their Slack workspace effectively.
   - Real-time Data Access: Utilizes Supabase's capabilities to fetch real-time data, ensuring users have up-to-date information at their fingertips.
   - Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to ensure that users receive meaningful feedback when issues arise.
## Description of the ColorStack API Dashboard
The ColorStack API Dashboard is a user-friendly interface that allows users to visualize their API usage and manage student data effectively. Built using React, it provides a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
Key Components:
   - User Welcome Section: Greets users by name and provides a personalized experience.
   - API Usage Statistics: Displays important metrics such as total API requests and the timestamp of the last request, helping users monitor their usage effectively.
   - Student Management: Features a table displaying student information with options for searching and filtering based on activation status. This section allows users to easily navigate through student records.
   - Responsive Navigation: Includes a navigation bar that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, providing quick access to different sections of the dashboard.

# Oyster Integration Plan
- We hope to make this go as big as possible! if this gets implemented in the future here is a design for quick integration within **Oyster** :)
