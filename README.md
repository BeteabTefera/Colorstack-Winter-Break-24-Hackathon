Welcome to the **Colorstack-API** repository!

This project was created for the **Colorstack Winter-Break Hackathon**. The goal of this project is simple. Lets break it down

## Problem

- ColorStack has oyster but issues are being limited

## Solution
- We created **[Colorstack-API](https://apiurlcolorstack.vercel.app/)** and **Colorstack-API-Dashboard** ðŸ¥³

## Overview
Description of the ColorStack API
The ColorStack API is a robust backend service designed to facilitate the management and interaction with various data entities related to educational and collaborative environments. It integrates seamlessly with Supabase, providing a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage users, Slack channels, messages, and reactions.
Key Features:
User Management: Allows for the retrieval and management of student profiles, including their details such as name and email.
Slack Integration: Provides endpoints to manage Slack channels, messages, and reactions, enabling users to interact with their Slack workspace effectively.
Real-time Data Access: Utilizes Supabase's capabilities to fetch real-time data, ensuring users have up-to-date information at their fingertips.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to ensure that users receive meaningful feedback when issues arise.
Description of the ColorStack API Dashboard
The ColorStack API Dashboard is a user-friendly interface that allows users to visualize their API usage and manage student data effectively. Built using React, it provides a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
Key Components:
User Welcome Section: Greets users by name and provides a personalized experience.
API Usage Statistics: Displays important metrics such as total API requests and the timestamp of the last request, helping users monitor their usage effectively.
Student Management: Features a table displaying student information with options for searching and filtering based on activation status. This section allows users to easily navigate through student records.
